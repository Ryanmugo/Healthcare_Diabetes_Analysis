# Healthcare Diabetes Analysis Project

# Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data using Python libraries such as SciPy, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The dataset contains information on individuals, including their glucose levels, age, BMI and Diabetes Status. The aim is to explore potential factors associated with diabetes.

# Contents:

- a) Data Cleaning and Processing.
- b) Glucose Level Distribution Analysis.
- c) Average Age and BMI Analysis.
- d) Distribution of BMI Across Age Groups.
- e) Categorization of BMI and Glucose Levels.
- f) Visualization of Categorized Data.
- g) Relationship Between BMI and Diabetes Status.


# a) Data Cleaning and Processing:

- Checked for null values in the dataset and performed necessary cleaning and processing steps.

# b) Glucose Level Distribution Analysis:

- Examined the distribution of glucose levels among individuals, distinguishing between diabetic and non-diabetic groups.

# c) Average Age and BMI Analysis:

- Analyzed the average Age and BMI of individuals in the dataset.

# d) Distribution of BMI Across Age Groups:

- Explored the distribution of BMI among age groups.

# e) Linear Regression Analysis:

- Conducted linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between age and BMI
- Generated a regression table for further insights.

# f) Correlation Analysis:

- Explored the correlation between BMI and Glucose Levels using a correlation matrix.
-  Conducted linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between BMI and Glucose Levels.
-  Generated a regression table for further insights.

# g) Categorization of BMI and Glucose Levels:

- Categorized BMI and Glucose Levels for better visualization and analysis.

# h) Visualization of Categorized Data:

- Visualized categorized BMI and Glucose Levels to understand patterns and trends.

# i) Relationship Between BMI and Diabetese Status:

- Investigated the relationship between BMI and Diabetes Status using linear regression analysis.

# Findings:

a) Average Age in the database was 33 years.
b) Average BMI was 32.14 indicating most guys are obese.
c) Average Glucose Level of an individual is 121.1 indicating most guys are Pre-Diabetes.
d) Number of Obese guys are 1704, Overweight are 654, Normal Weight are 357, Underweight are 53.
e) Number of guys who are Diabetic are 1086, Pre-Diabetes are 1682.
f) There is no relationship between Age and BMI based from linear regression analysis that i undertook.
g) There is relationship between BMI and Outcome(1 representing diabetic and 0 representing non-diabetic) based from linear regression analysis that i undertook.
